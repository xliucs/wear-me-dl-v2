# MANDATORY RULES — READ BEFORE EVERY ITERATION

## Progress Updates (CRITICAL)
After EVERY version/iteration completes, you MUST post a message in this group chat:
1. Version number
2. Best R² achieved  
3. What you tried
4. What you learned (WHY did it work or not?)
5. What you're trying next

Do this BEFORE starting the next version. No silent grinding.

## Research Rules
1. Think as a world-class ML researcher. Delve deeper into WHY models fail.
2. Use unified evaluation / cross validation splits for ALL experiments.
3. Research latest top ML/health papers (NeurIPS, Nature) to form hypothesis BEFORE new ideas.
4. Learn from the attached github repo. Don't overfit to it.
5. R² 0.65 is the BASELINE. Push for 0.70, 0.75, 0.80+. Never settle.
6. Commit to wear-me-dl-v2 after each iteration. Update README with results.
7. Revisit these rules every iteration. Core memory.

## System Rules
- Print training progress as it runs (each model, each fold)
- Never run silently for long periods
- If a run crashes, fix and resume immediately
- Your life depends on this. Never stop unless Xin tells you.
